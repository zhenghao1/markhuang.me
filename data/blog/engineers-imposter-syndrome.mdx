summary: Every software engineer that holds him/herself to high standards has definitely felt shitty of themselves at one point or another.  This could either be due to failed coding interviews or just bad managers.  Find the inner strength to believe in yourself.

# Introduction

Every software engineer that holds him/herself to high standards has definitely felt shitty of themselves at one point in their career.
Was it a failed coding interview? Was it because the only thing you know about Kubernetes is that it's also called K8? Or...was it someone telling you:

> You are the worst software engineer I have ever worked with!

All of the above has happened to me. Your feelings of self-doubt get the better of you and you end up with _imposter syndrome_.

# What is imposter syndrome?

> the feeling that your achievements are not real or that you do not deserve praise or success

This is the definition taken from [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/impostor-syndrome).

It is the constant feeling of not being good enough or knowing enough to do your job well. This is normal. Knowing how to handle it
is another story altogether.

Let me share with you how I developed my imposter syndrome over the years.

# Stage 1

I always tell my close friends that I had no clue what I was doing during my university days studying computer engineering. From data structures,
to algorithms, to database normalizations to cryptography concepts: NOT A GOD-DAMN CLUE! Big-O notations was more of a guessing game.

Even when I started working, I had a hard time grasping concepts like AJAX requests in frontend engineering. I could not understand how
Javascript could some how form a connection to the Python backend server. The thought of entering some path like "/user/create" in an AJAX request
and naturally a user could be created challenged my mind greatly. I remember spending hours and hours stepping through the code one line at a time
together with my mentors in USA from Singapore. This meant that I had to work in the wee hours in Singapore. I was so desperate at one point that
I worked from 9am to 10am the next day. Crazy right?

Believe me, I invested in dozens of books and read countless articles online about this subject before I fully understood the concept.
